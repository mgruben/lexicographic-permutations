# lexicographic-permutations 
Given a lexigraphically ordered list, returns the ith possible ordered permutation of those items.

For example:
```
{0, 1, 2}, 6 -> "210"
{1, 2, 3, 4}, 18 -> "3421"
{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}, 555555 -> "1582670439"
```

This project was completed for [Project Euler - Problem 24](https://projecteuler.net/problem=24).

I recommend that this code should only be viewed _after_ you've completed your own implementation.  
If you're super stuck, take a break, take a walk, and it will come to you; good luck.
